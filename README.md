# SAPEmulator

A compatible SAP-2 emulator

## What is SAP-2?

SAP-2 is a basic computer architecture designed & used specifically for academic purpose. Its primary purpose is to develop an understanding how computer architecture works.
With this emulator you can test, run, or (possibly) debug your SAP-2 program. AFAIK, currently there is no emulator available for this architecture, so i decided to build one. 
This emulator still in development, so a contributions are welcome..
